## Welcome to my page!

I am currently a Phd-student in populations genomics with a specialisation in cattle et ovine species.
This page shows some of R-scripts I have created for several projects I worked.


### Cartography

I have created this map for my Phd project :

To obtain the script [carto_clim_ovin_bovin.R](https://github.com/magnierj/cartography).

### Teaching

I was in charge of teaching "statistics analysis" for Msc students in process engineering in September 2015. More specifically, I taught Single and Multiple Linear Regression, Experimental planning and Principal Components Analysis method. You can found Teaching-documents [here](https://github.com/magnierj/teaching).




You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/magnierj/magnierjessica.github.io/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/magnierj/magnierjessica.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
